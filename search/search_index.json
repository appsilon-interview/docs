To build the image, clone the repository: $ git clone git@github.com:appsilon-interview/app.git $ cd app And run: $ make build After image is built, you will need to push it to the DockerHub. To do so, log into DockerHub first: $ export DOCKER_PASSWORD = <your dockerhub password> $ export DOCKER_USERNAME = <your dockerhub username> $ echo \" ${ DOCKER_PASSWORD } \" | docker login --username \" $DOCKER_USERNAME \" --password-stdin Tag and push image: $ make publish Deploying Infrastructure \u00b6 In order to deploy a staging environment with all required AWS components, a dedicated terraform module was created.

AWS 2 public cloud is used as a Cloud provider of choice. R-Shiny 3 is used as a framework for example application. All Docker images are stored in public DockerHub 4 registry. Entire source code is stored in GitHub 's appsilon-interview organisation.
